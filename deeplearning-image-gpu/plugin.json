This plugin provides several tools to manipulate image data.\nIt is possible to use a pre trained model to score images and obtain classes, or use it to extract its antepenultimate layer for each image.\nA macro lets you download some popular pretrained models to a folder.\nYou can retrain a model to specialize it on a particular set of images.<p><b>Requirements</b>: Access to a NVIDIA graphics card, with CUDA 8.0 and cudNN 6.0 installed.</p>",
